<p class="ctop"><i>To Whom It May Concern:</i></p>

<p>In order to clear up any misunderstanding
or false impressions regarding
the amazing case of my beloved
friend and co-worker, Professor Howard
E. Edwards, I submit herewith,
extracts from the professor's notebook,
which I found on the desk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evans Barclay, B.S.</span> Fellow IRE.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Jan. 25.</i></p>

<p>Last night, in my dreams, I was a
monstrous ant, and had been digging
myself a burrow in the soft fresh
earth. The dream was intensely real,
and when I awoke, I felt as tired as if
I had actually been digging. My arms
ached, and I was astonished, upon
examining my hands, to find them raw.</p>

<p>Dressing hastily, I rushed to the
back yard, and there, sure enough,
near the fence, was a large hole about
two feet deep and three feet long.
Hurriedly, I filled it in and returned
to the house.</p>

<p>I must rest for a few days, as I
feel that the intense excitement caused
by my investigations, is preying too
heavily upon my mind.</p>

<p>At this time, I feel that I should
make a brief summary of my findings
in respect to the ants, so that Barclay
may go over these notes upon his return
from his vacation.</p>

<p><i>First:</i> The ant colony is the source
of a powerful bell-like tone which is
radiated continuously on two wave-lengths,
.0018 meter, and .00176 meter.
This tone acts as a radio-beacon,
and directs the ants to the colony,
no matter where they may be located.
The .0018 meter wave is used by
the ants for their "clacking" conversations,
by means of which they communicate
with each other and the colony,
receiving orders from the directing
intelligence, reporting the location
of food, and requesting help, when
needed.</p>

<p>The wave .00176 meter, is used for
sending thought images or pictures
which may be sent with the "clacking"
code, or independently. I cannot
conceive a more efficient or highly specialized
communications system. I
<i>must</i> learn their secret, their methods.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Jan. 30.</i></p>

<p>This morning, while sitting at the
receiver in a semi-doze, with the bell-tone
ringing in my ears, I fell into that
state known as "day-dreaming." Little
"Nippy," my beloved fox terrier,
and constant companion, rushed into
the laboratory and ran up to me.</p>

<p>For a moment my mind went blank.
My hands shot out. I grasped the dog
around the throat and began to throttle
him. I had risen from my chair,
and the dog was nearly dead, when I
slipped and fell, pulling the phone
plug out of the receiver.</p>

<p>Instantly, my mind cleared, and
words cannot express the remorse I
felt at my inhuman actions. Nippy
would have nothing to do with me,
and crawled dejectedly from the room,
a terrified look in his eyes.</p>

<p>I have no explanation for my actions.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Feb. 3.</i></p>

<p>The transmitter is ready for operation.
I have constructed a pair of metal
disc-electrodes which clamp tightly
to my head and press upon my temples.
This device will pick up the
thought impulses from my brain, feed
them directly into the radio-frequency
amplifier, where they will be amplified,
and then radiated in a tight directed
beam.</p>

<p>My two ants were in their little enclosure
under the microscope when I
threw the switch to the "send" position.
I pictured myself as I looked
as a man, and sent the thought, "I am
a man."</p>

<p>Hastily, I threw the switch to the
"receive" position. I looked through
the microscope.</p>

<p>The ants were lying on their sides.
Somehow, I felt that the power was
too great, and had stunned them.
Keeping my eye to the microscope, I
again threw the switch to "send," and
cut the power to half.</p>

<p>"Get up, friends ... get up," I
thought, as I pictured them rising.
Sure enough ... the ants slowly regained
their feet. They looked about
in apparent bewilderment. Back
again, in "receive" position, I was
conscious of the thought image,</p>

<p>"The man ... he is the man. The
man holds us here. He is killing us.
We must kill the man."</p>

<p>They gnashed their fierce-looking
mandibles. I snapped back to "send"
and thought.</p>

<p>"No ... you must not kill the man.
The man will not harm you ... he is
your friend. He will help you."</p>

<p>As I watched, the ants seemed to
become less excited. From the larger
of the two, I received the thought,</p>

<p>"We are dying. The man is killing
us with his strong vibrations. We
must kill the man."</p>

<p>Then a very powerful thought impression
burst upon my brain.</p>

<p>It seemed to come from the colony,
three feet away.</p>

<p>"Warning to the man. Stop your
thought transmissions at once! Your
vibrations are killing us. We want
nothing from you. We have everything
we need. You will learn nothing
from us. You will stop <i>at once</i>!"</p>

<p>I threw the switch to "send."
Viewed through the microscope, the
two ants were lying on their backs
... dead, to all appearances.</p>

<p>"What if I don't stop?" I sent the
thought question, "I want to learn the
secret of your communication. In return,
I will teach you many things. I
can't stop now!"</p>

<p>I changed to receive, and the answer
came back,</p>

<p>"If you do not stop ... we will kill
you!"</p>

<p>I turned off the apparatus, but the
powerful bell tone continued to pound
incessantly into my brain.</p>

<p>I laughed. They'd kill me ... would
they? Those tiny insects ... what
could they do? Well&mdash;let them try, but
I'd get what I was after. I would not
quit now, with success so near. What
if my transmissions did kill a few of
them? Of what importance were the
lives of a few ants as compared to
the advancement of the science of
Communication?</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Feb. 9.</i></p>

<p>I found myself digging again in the
back yard yesterday. As before, I had
been "day-dreaming," when an overwhelming
desire to go outside and feel
the cool moist earth between my fingers
and on my face took possession
of me.</p>

<p>I rushed out into the back yard, and
began digging feverishly ... madly,
until finally I fell, exhausted. Then my
mind cleared and I filled in the hole.</p>

<p>About half the ants have died, due
no doubt to the strength of my radiations.
No matter how low I cut the
power, they still cannot live but a
short time under the force of my
transmissions. They have stopped
sending thought impressions entirely,
and are using only their "clacking"
code signals, which they seem to realize
I cannot understand.</p>

<p>I feel that they are undertaking
some sort of campaign against me.
For hours they congregate, closely
packed, their antennae stiffly pointed
straight up. Their thought currents
seem to be flowing into and merging
with the bell tone, which grows
stronger and more penetrating day
by day.</p>

<p>In my back yard, there are four
large ant hills, and at each hill, curiously,
there is no activity except the
same mass concentration of the ants.
Have they, too, been affected by my
radiations and joined forces with the
original colony against myself?</p>

<p>The bell tone continues to grow
stronger.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Feb. 11</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Winslow, the middle-aged
widow, who comes to clean my house
and laboratory twice a week, was here
this morning.</p>

<p>She is short, dumpy, and inclined
to be stout. As she went about her
work, I noticed particularly the fat
firm flesh of her neck, just below the
jaw. I felt an uncontrollable desire to
sink my teeth deep into that flesh, and
enjoy the taste of the warm fresh
blood.</p>

<p>I had actually risen from my chair
to accomplish my desire, when the
telephone rang ... and my mind
cleared.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Feb. 14.</i></p>

<p>I have decided to stop my experiments
with the ants.</p>

<p>As they refuse to send any more
thought impressions, there is nothing
further I can learn from them. Somehow,
I feel that they are gaining a hold
upon my mind, and that every time I
listen in on the receiver, that hold becomes
stronger. I firmly believe that I
would have attacked poor Mrs. Winslow,
had not the ringing of the 'phone
so opportunely interrupted me. I have
sent word for her to stay away ...
as I cannot trust myself.</p>

<p>I keep a box of fresh earth on the
table in my laboratory. I often run my
hands through it, and taste it. It is
remarkable how much this soothes my
nerves.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Feb. 16.</i></p>

<p>It is too late!</p>

<p>For two days, I have kept my apparatus
shut off. I have not so much
as looked at the ants, but still that
confounded bell tone rings in my ears
with all the insistence of African tom-toms.
Hour by hour ... the tone becomes
more penetrating. I cannot
sleep, and can eat but little.</p>

<p>As a last resort, I destroyed my ant
colony. I even went so far as to pour
boiling water on the four ant hills in
my yard.</p>

<p>Still ... the bell tone persists. I can
stand it no longer!</p>

<p>Perhaps if I were to dig ... again
in the yard ... in the soothing earth,
I could forget....</p>

<p class="center">(News Clipping: From Philadelphia
Banner)<br />RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
ENGINEER DEAD<br />Howard E. Edwards, Suicide</p>

<p><i>Philadelphia, Feb. 18.</i> The body of
Howard E. Edwards, B.S., PhD.,
Member I. R. E., eminent authority
on Radio Communications, aged 56,
was found this morning in the back
yard of his residence, 1427 Raines
Avenue. The body was almost completely
buried in a long narrow hole
in the ground.</p>

<p>At first, foul-play was suspected,
but later it appeared that Edwards
had dug himself into the ground and
died of suffocation, as his nostrils and
mouth were filled with dirt.</p>

<p>Dr. P. A. Hofner, who examined
the body, found no wounds, stated
that Edwards had been dead for about
two days, and pronounced the death
as a clear case of suicide, the strange
means employed probably due to an
unbalanced mental condition.</p>

<p>Elaborate radio apparatus upon
which Edwards had been working had
been smashed to bits.</p>
